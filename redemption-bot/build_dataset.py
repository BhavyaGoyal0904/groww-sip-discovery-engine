 "Short-term falls are common in equity, and the data shows they tend to smooth out with time. Since 1999, the Nifty 50 TRI was negative in about 24% of 1-year periods, about 6% of 3-year periods and in none of the 7-year periods. For midcaps specifically, the Nifty Midcap 150 TRI was -0.6% over the last 1 year but 17.6% a year over 10 years (as of Sep 2026)."+PAST,

 "Nobody can predict that reliably, and timing exits is harder than it looks. From 2005 to 2026, staying invested in the Nifty 50 TRI returned 13.7% a year; missing just the 10 best days cut it to 9.8%. Those best days often come within two weeks of the worst ones, right when people have exited."+PAST,

r("T04","returns","detail","Returns are lower than expected","only 10% | expected more",
 "Two things help put this in context. First, the 10.92% is an absolute return; for SIPs, XIRR (shown in holding details) gives the yearly rate. Second, year-to-year returns vary widely: Nifty 50 TRI 1-year returns since 1999 ranged from -55% to +108%, while 10-year returns ranged from 5% to 22% a year."+PAST,

 "A fair check is to compare it with its benchmark (Nifty Midcap 150 TRI) and the midcap category average over 3-5 years, not a few months; the monthly factsheet has these. If you decide to move to another fund, note that switching counts as a redemption, so exit load and tax apply. I can't recommend specific funds.",
